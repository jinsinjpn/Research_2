2018-01-31 14:41:18,051  WARN DvrpConfigConsistencyChecker:35 Typically, vrp paths are calculated from startLink to endLink(not from startNode to endNode). That requires making some assumptionson how much time travelling on the first and last links takes. The current implementation assumes freeflow travelling on the last link, which is actually the case in QSim, and a 1-second stay on the first link. The latter expectation is optimistic, and to make it more likely,departing vehicles must be inserted befor driving ones (though that still does not guarantee 1-second stay
